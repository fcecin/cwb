// mux.h — CesPlex, the CES-protocol connection controller / multiplexer
//
// CesPlex is a Layer-1, general-purpose mechanism: it latches onto a MINX
// engine that speaks CES and multiplexes it. It knows the CES protocol and
// nothing about who hosts it (see CesPlexHost — the only host interface:
// sign + rate disclosure + a sink for measured resource usage). CesServer uses
// one on its secondary port; a ledgerless host (the cesluajitd compute
// child) can use one too. The L2 protocols
// (file / compute / lua) are handlers that ride this bus — users of it,
// not part of it.
//
// Every inbound RUDP channel speaks a SIGNED protocol-select handshake
// (the bind contract — see cesplex/wire.h for the wire format) before any
// protocol-specific bytes flow. On bind OK, the handler registered under
// the requested name takes over the channel for its life and the channel
// is metered against its bound payer. On NACK, the channel closes.
//
// Handler shape: statically-linked C++ handler, registered at program
// load via a Meyer-style static init into a process-wide registry.
// CES core ships handlers for "file", "compute", and "lua"; downstream
// binaries can register their own (e.g., a content-server linking
// ceslib to add "rpc"). The protocol name "/ces/rpc/1" is reserved
// but unhandled by CES core itself.
//
// Threading: a CesPlex instance lives on its host's single bus strand
// (the CesServer's rpcTaskIO_). All of acceptInbound / per-channel
// session callbacks / handler.serve invocations run on that strand. A
// handler that wants to do anything long-running should hop off to
// another executor; the framework keeps its own bookkeeping on the strand.
//
// Extensibility: a CesPlex serves only handler objects its host mounts
// via mount(). The host owns the name->class choice (CesServer does it in
// resolveBuiltin). No global registry, no dynamic loading, no plugin API.

// Handler base class
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A CesPlexHandler owns an inbound RUDP channel once the select handshake
// has completed successfully with its registered name. The single
// virtual is `serve`; the handler implements whatever protocol it
// speaks by reading/writing on the stream and closing when done.
//
// Handlers are long-lived SINGLETONS (one instance per protocol,
// registered once at static-init time). `serve` may be called for
// many channels — interleaved on the rpcTaskIO_ strand, not in
// parallel across threads — so handler state must use per-channel
// state captured in its own async continuations. No mutexes are
// needed for the strand-shared bookkeeping; do need them for state
// shared with handler-internal threads (if the handler spawns any).
//
// LIFETIME CONTRACT — every handler MUST obey this:
//
//   The handler is the SOLE strong owner of the stream after serve()
//   returns. CesPlex holds only a weak reference, used for routing
//   inbound bytes while the handler is active. When the handler is
//   done (successful completion, error, or peer disconnect), it must
//   drop every shared_ptr it holds to the stream. That destructs the
//   stream, which closes the RUDP channel, and CesPlex's weak_ptr
//   expires. CesPlex detects expiry lazily (on the next inbound
//   receive for that channel) and erases its session bookkeeping.
//
//   Consequence: if a handler stashes a shared_ptr<RudpStream> into
//   a long-lived context and forgets to release it, the channel
//   leaks. The framework does not detect or alarm on this; handlers
//   that spawn async op chains should have their outermost
//   continuation release the stream on both success AND failure paths.

// host-owned: the syscall burns `value` from the caller; on Delivered the
// host mints it to the payee, on a failure it refunds the caller. The
// built-in owns the fine addressing (the opaque `blob`) and the attempt.

// payer. NoHandler is a permanent, immediate refuse (no registered target);
